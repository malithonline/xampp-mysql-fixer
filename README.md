# xampp-mysql-fixer
This is a batch script designed to fix common MySQL startup errors in XAMPP (like "Error: MySQL shutdown unexpectedly"). This error usually happens when database files get corrupted or another program blocks the MySQL port.  The script automates the manual process of resetting the data folder while keeping your databases intact.
